avable functions:
 "+" "-" "*" "/" "^" 
 
 abs(x), sqrt(x)
 
 log(x) - natural logarithm 
 
 lg(x) - decimal logarithm 
 
 sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) 
 
 arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x) 
 
 sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x) 
 
it's not supporting correctly something like 
sin(-x) use instead sin(0 - x), instead "sin" can be any of functions above 
 
it's supporting nested functions like 
sin(cos(x))
tan(abs(log(x)))

in plans add setting different functions on x and y like

y = f(k)

x = g(k)
