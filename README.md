avable functions:
 "+" "-" "*" "/" "^" \n
 abs(x), sqrt(x)
 log(x) - natural logarithm \n
 lg(x) - decimal logarithm \n
 sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) \n
 arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x) \n
 sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x) \n
  \n
it's not supporting correctly something like \n
sin(-x) use instead sin(0 - x), instead "sin" can be any of functions above \n
 \n
it's supporting nested functions like 
sin(cos(x))
tan(abs(log(x)))

in plans add setting different functions on x and y like
y = f(k)
x = g(k)
